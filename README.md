# 🧠 AI/ML Learning Journey 🚀

This repository is a personal log of my hands-on learning in the field of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. It contains practical notebooks, experiments, and projects that I’ve built from scratch to understand and apply core ML concepts.

---

## 📘 What's Inside

- Beginner to advanced Python code for AI/ML
- Data analysis using real-world datasets
- Clean and documented Jupyter/Colab notebooks
- Step-by-step learning and experimentation
- Personal projects and mini challenges

---

## 🎯 Goal

To become a **job-ready Machine Learning Engineer** by learning consistently through real datasets, hands-on coding, and applied projects.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks**

## 💡 Why This Repo?

Rather than just watching tutorials or reading theory, I’m building this repository to:
- Apply what I learn immediately
- Track my progress in one place
- Build a portfolio of work to share with recruiters or collaborators

---

## 🔗 How to Use

- Browse through the notebooks
- Open them in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter
- Modify, run, and learn from the code
